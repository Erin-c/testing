# Project 0

## Objectives

- Familiarize you with HTML and CSS.
- Introduce you to a web-based IDE.

## Getting Ready

First, take this tour of HTTP, the "protocol" via which web browsers and web servers communicate.

Then consider reviewing some of these examples, via which we introduced HTML.

Next, consider reviewing some of these other examples, via which we introduced CSS.

## Dive into HTML

Okay, it's time to make (your first?) website and get acquainted with a web-based IDE (integrated development environment), which we'll use for subsequent projects as well.

Let's first get you set up with the latter.

1. If you don't already have an edX account, visit [courses.edx.org/register](https://courses.edx.org/register) and create a new one using your email address and a password.
1. Click **Create Account** and create a free account. Take care to remember your username and password.
1. Visit [cs50.io](https://cs50.io/) and log in via your edX account.

Within a few seconds you should find yourself in an environment similar to what we used in Day 0! Feel free to tinker with settings. If you are instead presented with the **Create a new workspace** page, under **Workspace name** enter **ide50**, under **Hosted workspace** select **Private**, and under **Choose a template** select **Harvard's CS50** then click **Create workspace**.

Let's next have you make yourself a web page!

1. Select **File > New File** within CS50 IDE's interface.
1. Then select **File > Save** and name the file `hello.html` (so that CS50 IDE knows it's an HTML file and will syntax-highlight it for you).
1. Create a super-simple webpage, perhaps identical to `hello.html` from the first class. To take another look at the first class's source code, visit [Classes]({{ site.baseurl }}/classes) atop the course's own website. If you click a file's name, you won't see the file's HTML but a rendered web page instead. To see the web page's actual HTML, control-click or right-click on the web page's background and select View Source (if using Chrome) or equivalent.
1. When ready to admire your work, select **File > Save** again. Then, within your terminal window, execute `http-server` to ensure that you workspace's web server is running. Then, in another tab, visit `https://ide50-jharvard.cs50.io/hello.html`, where `jharvard` is your own username (not John Harvard's). You should see your web page! If you instead see "No application seems to be running here!", be sure you executed `http-server` successfully.

Now let's have you make an actual website with multiple pages. We'll leave its design largely up to you, subject only to the following requirements.

- Your website must live at `https://ide50-jharvard.cs50.io/index.html`, where `jharvard` is your own username. Your website's main page, then, should live in a file called `index.html`, since most web servers serve up `index.html` by default, in the absence of an explicit file name in a URL.
- Your website must include a least two (2) other pages (with any filenames, so long as they end in .html), and your website's main page (i.e., index.html) must somehow link to those pages, as via HTML's `a` tag.
- Your website must include at least one image.
- Your website must be stylized with at least some CSS, which must live in an "external stylesheet" called `styles.css` (a la Day 0's `css4.html` and `css4.css` example).
- Your website should be more complex than Day 0's examples. As such, your website should probably use a few dozen HTML tags overall, plus one or more CSS properties.

Alright, off you go again. Make us proud!

If you've any questions along the way, do just reach out to classmates and staff!
