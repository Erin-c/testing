# Project 1

## Objectives

* Familiarize you with responsive design.
* Acquaint you with Python.

## Dive Back into HTML

This project is an opportunity to improve your implementation of [Project 0](0). Here's what to do:

1. Ensure that each of the web pages that you created for Project 0 is "responsive," such that they display nicely (i.e., legibly and user-friendly) on laptops and mobile phones alike, as by minimally including `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>` in each of your pages or, better yet, using a library like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). If you opt for the latter approach, search Bootstrap's documentation for "responsive."
1. Ensure that each of the web pages that you created for Project 0 is "valid" according to the [W3C's validator](http://validator.w3.org/). It should suffice to paste, one at a time, your page's URLs into the validator's **Address** bar, below **Validate by URI**, then click **Check**. If you see any (red) errors, be sure to redress. If you see "The character encoding was not declared.", simply add `<meta charset="utf-8"/>` inside of your page's `head` element so that the validator doesn't need to guess your page's character encoding.
1. Port Project 0 to Flask as follows.
	1. Create an `application.py` file and a `templates/` directory, much like we saw in class.
	1. For each of the web pages that you created for Project 0, recreate it as a template in `templates/`, factoring out any HTML that's common to all of those pages to a layout in `templates/layout.html`.
	1. For each of those same pages, create a route in `application.py` that routes users to the appropriate template.

## Reminders

Be sure to run `flask run` in the same directory as is `application.py`.
