## Instructor

## Description

This course introduces students to the principles and practice of web programming. The session begins with a brief introduction to HTML and CSS and quickly transitions to server-side programming with Python and client-side scripting with JavaScript. Topics include Ajax, DOM, event handling, HTTP, MVC, relational databases, and user experience. Projects include web applications with front-end user interfaces (mobile and desktop) and back-end application programming interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Students must have one or more years of prior programming experience (in any language). Students must bring a laptop computer to each class meeting.

## Expectations

You are expected to attend all classes and complete all projects.

## Lectures

Via lectures are the course's concepts introduced and hands-on projects begun.

## Seminars

Seminars explore topics from lectures in more detail as well as explore topics beyond the scope of lectures.

## Office Hours

Office hours are opportunities for guidance and feedback from the staff on assignments as well as for discussion of the course's material more generally.

## Academic Honesty

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all answers that you submit to this course for assignments must be your own. Collaboration on assignments is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your answers to classmates and others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy's other constraints.

The essence of all code that you submit to this course for projects must be that of your team. Collaboration with classmates on projects is allowed so long as you collaborate with no more than two classmates, so long as you disclose any collaborators' names, and so long as all collaborators' contributions are similar in scope. You may ask classmates and others outside of your team for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to classmates and others outside of your team, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy's other constraints.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course's instructor. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.
Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about assignments in English (or some other spoken language).
- Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.
- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code in class, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.
- Incorporating snippets of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those snippets are not themselves solutions to assignments and that you cite the snippets' origins.
- Sending or showing an answer or code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a mistake.
- Sharing snippets of your own answers or code online so that others might help you identify and fix a mistake.
- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to projects.
- Whiteboarding solutions to assignments with others outside of your team using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.
- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

## Not Reasonable

- Asking a classmate to see his or her answer or code before (re-)submitting your own.
- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.
- Giving or showing to a classmate an answer or code when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling with their own.
- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.
- Providing or making available answers or code to individuals who might take this course in the future.
- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to assignments online or elsewhere.
- Submitting (after possibly modifying) another's words without attribution for some assignment.
- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond allowed snippets.
- Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.
- Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course's instructor.
- Viewing another's solution to an assignment and basing your own solution on it.
